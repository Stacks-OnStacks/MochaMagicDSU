Mocha Magic Project 1 Retrospectives

Elham: If given another chance, she would focus a lot more on data validation. While validation was not a big requirement, she would have liked to work more with unit testing/input validation for the application as a whole, specifically with the services layer.



Khalis: If given more time, he would have had a lot better communication with his project partner from the start of the project, which in turn would have allowed the two of them to make a lot more progress on P1.



Kim: If she could start over, she would have liked to put more time into unit testing, rather than just working on the functional code. Overall, she wants to carry out a lot more testing. Additionally, git flow could have used some improvement with the branches.



Tanner: If given a chance to start over, he would go through his code for code comments, written at the time of each functions creation. He would also opt to study more terminology for a better understanding of the P1 fundamentals.



Pitmon: If given more time, he would have put a LOT more time into making unit tests functional. We had all these test suites with not many tests in them, and intermittent testing as the functions are being created would have made the application much more smooth.

Elham: Yesterday, she got finished with most of user, but still has some work to do on usercontroller. Struggled with connecting to the db, like we all have. Will still be working on user package today, and will finish documentation along with it.



Khalis: Yesterday, he got files made for game class, created folders for dto, and got work done on games package. Struggled a little with Spring, but has also been practicing, and will be working on getting game class written out.



Kim: Yesterday, she worked on tiers, and respective class and repo. Remember to do documentation! Will finish services and controller for tiers, and still needs to connect to db.



Tanner: Yesterday, he worked mostly with spring, and set up game detail class, while removing unneeded hibernate util and associated test suite. Will get connected to the DB. Struggled a little with spring, but will get things figured out with more practice!



Pitmon: Yesterday, worked on user payments package, and got a fair amount of the utility package done as well. Struggled a little with spring, and the yaml config file going up to the remote repo, but got it sorted out!

Elham: Yesterday, she changed some data validation methods in services, and handled them in the request with hibernate data validation annotations. Also finished user controller, and has all finished but not tested the registration and login functionality - needs tiers to be finished for testing.
	No struggles for yesterday, and wants to start unit tests for Users class today.


Khalis: Yesterday, he got game services and controller started, and changed the repo from class to interface. Also worked on getting DTOs for game finished. Struggled with not really knowing which specific services to add, especially so with spring. Will get Game Service finished by today.



Kim: Yesterday, she did a lot of CRUD functionality for tier, as well as testing with validation for tier creation. Still needs to add some functionality for tier, and will add the UI repo as well 



Tanner: Yesterday, he helped Elham with input validation. Also set up most of game details, and fixed the DB tables! Struggled with figuring out EXACTLY what we are doing with certain aspects of the application. Plans to finish game_details today, with tests and comments. 



Pitmon: Yesterday, worked on user payment services, repo, and dto for new payment + response. Needs to add updatepaymentinfo to dto reqs, and finish the controller with repo for user payments. Struggled with DB tables yesterday.

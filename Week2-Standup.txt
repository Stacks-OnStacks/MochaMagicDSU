3- What do you going to implement today?


Kim:


1- Same as yesterday, but she implemented a lot of the utilities. Worked on one of the classes, and focused mostly on the dao stuff rather than the menus.

2- Had a hard time with comparing Nabnak to P0, there's a LOT on the Nabnak board, and it's hard to track in certain places 

3- Wants to work more DAO and services classes for P0 


Pitmon:

1- Got some more work done on adding classes required, but may have too many and needs to trim some off. I'm not making this app as robust as the Kanban board

2- Struggled with following the Kanban board and connecting the dots with the P0 app... there's so much to go over for the board, I really want a solid workday! 

3- Will be getting the DAOs figured out today, and setting up everything for registeration 

Tanner:

1- Looked through Nabnak to refresh on what can be used for P0, trying to get a good scope of the project and its necessities 

2- Wants to work on the DAO as well, and get the database hooked up as to not store info in a data.txt file 

3- Struggled with where to put the funds of the banking app... Where can we put the money to be deposited and withdrawln from 


Elham:

1- Worked on skeleton and business model, wants to wait until we get the database connected to implement the login page. Designed tables for SQL as well.

2- No struggles from yesterday, but did have some trouble with interfaces 

3- Wants to create the tables for SQL, and work on the login page if time allows.

3- What are you going to implement today?


Kim:

1- She worked on SQL injection yesterday 

2- she got food poisoning yesterday, and this is what she struggled with yesterday.

3- She will try to finish SQL injection for her other classes today


Pitmon:

1- The state of his project is good.

2- Something he struggles with right now is that he has a LinkedList, but he is not sure where to go with it. Also, he is trying to figure out the flow of the program.

3- He wants to implement the LinkedList today and create his accounts methods like Withrow and deposit.

Tanner:

1- He did the SQL injection and ability to Withrow money, and he also did SQL tables.

2- The trouble he had was creating ArrayList.

3- Today, he wants to have his MVP finished. 


Elham:

1- Yesterday I finished up member registration through memberservices and memberDao. It means that right now, the registration data can successfully add to the table in the database.

2- One roadblock for me was handling data in the memberDao and sending it to the database.

3- I am going to work on the logging page menu, which is pretty much the same as the registration page. Then I'll start to work on my app dashboard, and I plan to finish it during the weekend.

Kim:

1- Project state is good. Services and dao for students and facaulty are done, course dao and services are coming next.

2- Course DAO and services will be finished today.

3- A struggle for this project was the scope of the project, and it turned out to be much bigger than expected.



Elham:

1- Project state is pretty much finished. Deposit and withdrawl are finished, and so are view accounts. Custom logger was added as well.

2- Today she will finish testing units and data validation for the services package, will also do documentation if time allows.

3- A struggle over the weekend was having trouble with the sql db, and putting together all the different pieces of the app's control flow.



Tanner:

1- Project state is almost finished, but there are still a few more crudable implementations to get working.

2- Have MVP finished by today, and add tests as needed once thats finished.

3- A current struggle is getting all the pieces together and working, finishing mvp is a must.



Pitmon:

1- Project state is good! We have the app all but working for mvp, all that needs to be added is the update portion of crudable, and a sql issue needs to be worked out as well. 

2- Have MVP finished by today! Documentation will be added tomorrow.

3- A current struggle is getting the sql server to work fully with the registration process.

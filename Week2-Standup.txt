Kim:


1- Same as yesterday, but she implemented a lot of the utilities. Worked on one of the classes, and focused mostly on the dao stuff rather than the menus.

2- Had a hard time with comparing Nabnak to P0, there's a LOT on the Nabnak board, and it's hard to track in certain places 

3- Wants to work more DAO and services classes for P0 


Pitmon:

1- Got some more work done on adding classes required, but may have too many and needs to trim some off. I'm not making this app as robust as the Kanban board

2- Struggled with following the Kanban board and connecting the dots with the P0 app... there's so much to go over for the board, I really want a solid workday! 

3- Will be getting the DAOs figured out today, and setting up everything for registeration 

Tanner:

1- Looked through Nabnak to refresh on what can be used for P0, trying to get a good scope of the project and its necessities 

2- Wants to work on the DAO as well, and get the database hooked up as to not store info in a data.txt file 

3- Struggled with where to put the funds of the banking app... Where can we put the money to be deposited and withdrawln from 


Elham:

1- Worked on skeleton and business model, wants to wait until we get the database connected to implement the login page. Designed tables for SQL as well.

2- No struggles from yesterday, but did have some trouble with interfaces 

3- Wants to create the tables for SQL, and work on the login page if time allows.

Questions to be answered :

1- What is the current state of your project?
2- Something you're struggling with doing the project0?
3- What are you going to implement today?


Kim:

1- Project state is good. Services and dao for students and facaulty are done, course dao and services are coming next.

2- Course DAO and services will be finished today.

3- A struggle for this project was the scope of the project, and it turned out to be much bigger than expected.



Elham:

1- Project state is pretty much finished. Deposit and withdrawl are finished, and so are view accounts. Custom logger was added as well.

2- Today she will finish testing units and data validation for the services package, will also do documentation if time allows.

3- A struggle over the weekend was having trouble with the sql db, and putting together all the different pieces of the app's control flow.



Tanner:

1- Project state is almost finished, but there are still a few more crudable implementations to get working.

2- Have MVP finished by today, and add tests as needed once thats finished.

3- A current struggle is getting all the pieces together and working, finishing mvp is a must.



Pitmon:

1- Project state is good! We have the app all but working for mvp, all that needs to be added is the update portion of crudable, and a sql issue needs to be worked out as well.

2- Have MVP finished by today! Documentation will be added tomorrow.

3- A current struggle is getting the sql server to work fully with the registration process.

1- Lot of the functionality for the database and create students and enroll them in classes.

2- Refactor some functionality and start on the testing.

3- Roadblock of a small mistake in their update statement.



Elham:

1- Finished my testing for project 0 and data validation for registration.

2- Creating documentation and go over the whole project.

3- Struggled with mocking for the tests.



Tanner:

1- Finished up all the functionality of P0 and finished most of the data validation.

2- Create all test for P0, set up the logger correctly, and remove all unnecessary print-outs.

3- A migraine.

Questions to be answered :

1- What did we accomplish?
 - We all were able to finish our projects and do MVP.
 - We all had some unit testing and some comments.
 - We all did something above minimum 70% completion.

2- What did we learn from p0?
Tanner - project is much bigger than initially thought
Pitmon - First application, everything seemed new, 3 layered architecture
Elham - showcasing your project is very important, testing as you go is VERY important
Kim - Application structure, databases

3- How can we improve?
 - Understand the project and plan things out from the get-go
 - Logging, Testing, Documentation needs to start from the beginning

 Course Registration:
 - Date checks
 - better information display

 Banking Application:
 - WAY MORE INPUT VALIDATION
 - Stronger passwords, encryption
 - multiple accounts
